Hi there!👋 

Last **April 2025** I got challenged to do **every web development course** we could find. A challenge I happily accepted. 🎉
And this projectfolder is a big part of that challenge as this is the main project folder for all the projects from [freeCodeCamp!](https://www.freecodecamp.org) Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum.

## 🧩 Extra Challenges

Every project comes with **extra challenges** from a teacher who reviews these projects.
For this one it was building 5 different templates to keep as a placeholder for as long as I'm working these projects.
Every project will come with it's own extra challenge itself 🥰
Soon this section will be updated with said extra challenges.

A little fun fact while you wait for this ReadMe to finish.  
  
💡 Did you know that animals can experience time differently from humans?  
To smaller animals the world moves much slower! So if you are ever late, just tell your boss that you were accidently living on Salamander time 🦎
